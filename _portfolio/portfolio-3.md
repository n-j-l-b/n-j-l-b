title: "Pretty Pictures"
excerpt: "My love for space began as many young people first wanting to learn about space, watching fun animations on the Science channel. I felt mesmerized by thinking about what stars look like up close in their entirety. I quickly became obsessed with scrolling through the the [r/astrophotography](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/) subreddit, admiring all the images these amateur astronomers were creating! I decided back then that when I go to college, I have to study astronomy and I *have* to get my hands on a telescope so I can take my own pretty pictures.

All of these images were taken using the 0.7m Planewave telescope at the Whitin Observatory and processed using PixInsight!
